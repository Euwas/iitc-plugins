# Quick Add PokeNav POI by Webhook Script

This is a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script that was originally developed by [Forte](https://github.com/pkmngots/iitc-plugins) and subsequently modified by [Sunkast](https://gist.github.com/sunkast/f38961398f91b7a31e4d29e46dd1264a) for use with an IITC map. (If you are not familiar with using IITC map for mapping out PokeStops and Gyms, I highly recommend you check out [Alfonso's PoGo Tools script](https://gitlab.com/AlfonsoML/pogo-s2/-/wikis/How-to-add-new-PoI-to-your-city). You will need to install this script first.) The original script added two links into the portal info screen to quickly copy to the clipboard the command to add the selected portal to your PokeNav POI database.

This script took the original concept further by sending the PokeNav POI command directly to your #PokeNav channel, using a Discord webhook. This version A huge shout out for [tehstone](https://github.com/tehstone) for cleaning up the original code and making configuration a lot easier!
