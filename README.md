# IITC-plugin
This repository has two scripts, both which are forks of Forte's PokeNav Quick Copy POI plugin for the Ingress Map. The original script was adapted to add two different use cases:

1. Add the quick-copy function to add PokeStops and Gyms to the Meowth bot
2. Add PokeStops and Gyms to PokeNav through a webhook, rather than copy and paste.

The Meowth functionality is available in the master branch.
The PokeNav webhook functionality is in the webhook branch. It is working but is still subject to tweaking.
